<h2>operating systems</h2>
The operating system (OS) is the most important program that runs on the computer. Every general-purpose computer should have an operating system to run other programs and applications. Computer operating systems perform basic tasks, such as recognizing input from the keyboard, sending output to the display screen, keeping track of files and directories on the storage drives, and controlling peripheral devices, such as printers.
For a large systems, the OS has even greater responsibilities and powers. It is like the traffic cop it makes sure that different programs and users running at the same time do not interfere with each other. The OS is also responsible for security, ensuring that unauthorized users do not access the system.
<h2>Software Platform for Applications</h2>
OS provide a software platform on top of that other programs, called application programs, can run. The application of programs must be written to run on top of a particular operating system. Your choice of operating system, therefore, determines to a great extent the applications you can run. For PCs, the most popular operating systems are DOS, OS/2, and Windows, but others are available, such as Linux.
